# ðŸŒ± Giulio's Digital Garden
**ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!** 

Welcome to my digital garden. This space will be used to share some notes I've written for myself that might be useful to others.

```ad-warning
title: About broken links
Note that links to some notes might have links that don't work. This is intentional because I'm sharing just a subset of my notes publicly.
```

## Where to start?
I have some notes about software dev stuff like [[05 notes/Cookies|Cookies]] and [[05 notes/Javascript Modules|Javascript Modules]]. Also technical, but not about software:  [[05 notes/CRISPR|CRISPR]].

Here are a few about innovation and business:
- [[05 notes/Technology Adoption Lifecycle|Technology Adoption Lifecycle]]
-  [[05 notes/Innovation Tournaments|Innovation Tournaments]]
-  [[05 notes/Innovation Landscape Map|Innovation Landscape Map]]

While these are more related to *thinking*:
- [[05 notes/Content Consumer Psychology|Content Consumer Psychology]]
- [[05 notes/First Principles Thinking|First Principles Thinking]]

## Who are you?
I'm Giulio, a software engineer and researcher. More info at: [gbottari.com](https://gbottari.com).
