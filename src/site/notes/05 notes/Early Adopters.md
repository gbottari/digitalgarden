Early Adopters acquire a product because they have a pain: they are facing financial losses and may be looking for competitive advantage over others. Or they have a very particular need that no one else has.

Early Adopters can adapt a new innovation to their needs, softening their rough spots. [^2]

Early adopters are thought leaders and influence other buyers through reviews and their social networks. [^3]

Early adopters make up 13.5% or the market.
