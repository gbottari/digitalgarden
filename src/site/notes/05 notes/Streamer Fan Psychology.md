## how does someone become a fan?
Basically, [[when people watch you a lot, they feel like they know you|when people watch you a lot, they feel like they know you]]. And they keep you company, make you laugh etc. You create a sort of one-way connection with them.  That also happens when music fans say that [[art saves lives|art saved their lives]].

I think humans are wired to admire and become awe-struck with highly skilled people. A lot of streamers are proficient gamers.

Another aspect is that all streamers are entertainers as well. They are able to play, code, cook and entertain their audience at the same time.

## why give money to these people?
"Donation" is kind of a misnomer because people aren't really needing money -- and some streamers are loaded. But people give money away because they want to achieve something.

The first is status within their community. Subscribers on Twitch gets badges, nameplates and so on. Their loyalty is also rewarded with different rewards after 1 and 2 years. Through that they can show that they are true fans and get their idol's attention.

A common and straightforward reason is that they want to support the streamer. They may know something about their personal lives that identify with. They may project themselves onto the streamer somehow and support their lifestyle.

Getting a reaction is also a big reason. Most streamers will give thanks. Depending on the amount, they get big reactions. These reactions and shout-outs are like autographs in video format. It is related to [[Cameo (app)|Cameo (app)]].
