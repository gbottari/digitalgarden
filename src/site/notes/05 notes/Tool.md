A tool is a device that is designed to perform a particular job.

Examples:
- a hammer is a device to drive nails
- a map is a device to help navigation
- a doorknob is a tool to make doors open or close

## Reliability
A good tool should be reliable in the sense that it should produce equivalent results if used correctly.

## Learning and Teaching
You can learn to use a tool and can teach to use it for the purpose it was designed.

## Verification
It is possible for yourself or other to verify that the tool was employed correctly after you used it.

## Distractions
A good tool does not distract us from the main work and help us focus on what matters. <sup>[2]</sup>
