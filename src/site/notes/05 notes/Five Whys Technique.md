From a design problem statement, ask why questions incrementally.

1. State the problem as you see it: "in what way may we create a better X"
2. Ask the 5 whys to increase how generality of the concept
3. Ask a few hows as well to focus the concept 

Why gives more options and is more broad.
- go to the point where you have the tools and means to design while being slightly more uncomfortable than you anticipated

*How* helps focus and is more narrow.
