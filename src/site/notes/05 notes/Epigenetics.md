Heritable code regulates gene expression and is part of the genome but not the DNA sequence itself.

Allows one to change the phenotype without changing the underlying DNA sequence.

That's why identical twins don't look the same.

## Mechanisms
### DNA Methylation
Add a methyl group (CH3) to a nucleotide.

### Histone Acetylation
TODO

### miRNA (microRNA)
TODO
